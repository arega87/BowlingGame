# BowlingGame

The project is splited into two steps, in the first step all steps are populated from the user input, 
the second step goes through all the frames to calculate the Score including the bonuses of each frame.

To test the project, it should first be compiled and then the package should be executed as follows `java -jar BowlingGame-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

While running the application, each frame rolls should be populated separately until 10 frames are complete. 

In case of wrong user input the application quits after 3 retries.
